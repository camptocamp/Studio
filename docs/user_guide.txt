User Guide
==========

This document contains instructions for end users of Studio.

Install Studio
--------------

Install Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Studio has two types of dependencies: pure Python dependencies, and system dependencies. Pure Python
dependencies will be installed as part of the installation of Studio. System dependencies, listed
below, are installed separately.

* Python 2.4 or 2.5 (2.5 is recommended)
* MapServer CGI, version 5.0 and higher
* MapServer MapScript Python, version 5.0 and higher
* OGRGDAL Python, version 1.5 and higher

On a Linux system, you can rely on your distribution packages (recommended).
For example, on Debian-like system, you would install the packages with::

    $ apt-get install python cgi-mapserver python-mapscript python-gdal

On a Windows system, you would need to install Python 2.5 from
http://www.python.org/download/releases/ and its ``pwin32`` (a.k.a
``win32api``) extension from
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=78018. You would rely on
the MS4W distribution from http://www.maptools.org/ms4w/ for MapServer and
OGRDAL (`2.3.1 <http://www.maptools.org/dl/ms4w/ms4w-2.3.1-setup.exe>`_ is the
current stable version).

On a Debian system, you can check that MapServer CGI works locally by testing the following URL in a browser::

    $ http://localhost/cgi-bin/mapserv

Install Studio
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start by creating a folder named ``studio``. This folder will contain your
installation of Studio.

You can now download the ``go-mapfish-studio.py`` script at::

    http://dev.camptocamp.com/packages/mapfish/go-mapfish-studio.py

Place it in the ``studio`` folder.

Now open a console, go into the ``studio`` folder and run the ``go-mapfish-studio.py`` script there::

    $ python go-mapfish-studio.py venv

``venv`` is the name of the virtual Python environment Studio will be installed
in. Don't worry if you don't know what a virtual Python environment, you don't
need to understand that to complete the installation.

Before going to the next section, you must activate the virtual environment.
You would use the following on a Unix system::

    $ source venv/bin/activate

and the following a Windows system::

    $ venv/Scripts/activate.bat

If you use Python 2.5 (enter ``python -V`` in a console to check) you're done
with the installation.

If you use Python 2.4, you need to install the ``pysqlite`` package as it is
not distributed with Python 2.4. On Unix do::

    $ easy_install --index-url=http://dev.camptocamp.com/packages/mapfish/all/index --allow-hosts=dev.camptocamp.com pysqlite

On Windows download
http://www.pylonshq.com/download/0.9.7/pysqlite-2.4.1.win32-py2.4.exe and
execute it.

Create Config
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that Studio is installed it is time that you create your own configuration
for using it::

    $ paster make-config Studio my_studio.ini

You will be asked for the database URL needed to setup a connection with your
database. If you press "Enter", a default sqlite database will be used. You are
done!

Feel free to adjust your newly created ``my_studio.ini`` configuration file to
your needs.

If you want to configure Studio with a PostgreSQL database, you will use a
database URL that looks like this
``postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname``. Studio assumes the database
``dbname`` has already been created and the user is allowed to connect to this
database. You can rely on `postgresql documentation
<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/>`__ to learn `how to create a new database
<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/manage-ag-createdb.html>`__.  You
will also need to install the ``psycopg2`` package in the Python virtual
environment, you can use that::

    $ easy_install --index-url=http://dev.camptocamp.com/packages/mapfish/all/index --allow-hosts=dev.camptocamp.com psycopg2

Set Up
^^^^^^

You now need to set up Studio, which means creating the database schema and insert initial data. This is as easy as::

    $ paster setup-app my_studio.ini

Start Up
^^^^^^^^

Your environnement is now setup with a new database freshly created with
initial data inserted.  You can now launch the HTTP server with this command::

    $ paster serve my_studio.ini

Two user accounts have been created by default:

* Admin user is the master user. He owns all permissions.
    * login: ``admin``
    * password: ``password``
* Enduser is a standard user. He owns all permissions except those to add/update/view datastores.
    * login: ``enduser``
    * password: ``password``

Work with Studio
----------------

Three Studio components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Studio UI is divided in three functional parts:

* Data: for the management of data stored as file or in a PostGis database
* MapFile: for the easy creation of MapFile and the definition of WMS / WFS services in MapServer
* MapFish: for the creation and publication of MapFish website

.. image:: images/studio_full_view.png

Work with Data manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Per default, two directories are configured:

* PostGis datastore: allow the user to store spatial data in a PostGis database
* Directory datastore: alow the user to use data as geospatial files (supported format: ESRI shapefile and raster georeferenced files)

How to import shapefiles in Studio ?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

    The procedure is the following::

        Select the "default (directory)" datastore
        Choose "Add a new datasource..." function
        Browse your filesystem to select a zip file containing the shapefile files (.shp, .dbf, .shx and .prj at least)
        and your file are uploaded to the server

How to load shapefile in Studio PostGis database ?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

    The procedure is the following::

        Select the "default (postgis)" datastore
        Choose "Add a new datasource..." function
        Browse your filesystem to select a zip file containing the shapefile files (.shp, .dbf, .shx and .prj at least)
        and your file are uploaded to the server and stored in the database

**Hint**

   ``Don't forget the prj file that contain the coordinate system information.``

Work with MapFile manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MapFile manager has two main goals:

* Create a MapFile with a wysiwyg editor
* Generate WMS / WFS webservice that can be used in a Spatial Data Infrastructure

How to create a new MapFile ?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

    The procedure is the following::

        Click on the "Create new mapfile..." function
        Select the "Global properties panel"
        Define a name for the mapfile
        Define a Projection (for example "+init=epsg:2154" for RGF_1993_Lambert_93 or "+init=epsg:21781" for CH1903_LV03)
        Define the image color (background color)
        And the extent of interest

**Hint**

   ``The MapFile properties are very well documented here:`` http://www.mapserver.org/mapfile/index.html#mapfile

**Hint**

   ``Avoid special character for MapFile name.``

**Hint**

   ``Always click on "Save mapfile" to observe the result of your modifications.``

How to create a new layer in the MapFile ?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

    The procedure is the following::

        Click on the "Create new layer..." function
        Choose a datastore (per default: "default (directory)" or "default (postgis)").
        You find then in the data source list the data you imported previously and the sample data provided with Studio. Select one dataset.
        Then you should see the data in the map viewer

.. image:: images/studio_mapfile_add_layer.png

**Hint**

   ``All the layers of a MapFile have to have different names, otherwise MapServer can't recognize them and will not be able to create maps.``

How to classify data based on attribute values ?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

    The procedure is the following::

        Hover the desired layer and click on the "Classifiy using wizard" icon on the right.
        Follow the classification wizard: select an attribute, select the classification process (quantile or unique value), define symbology...
        ... and click on classify. Studio will generate the classes.
        Save the MapFile and you can see the result in the map preview

.. image:: images/studio_mapfile_classification_wizard.png

**Hint**

   ``Don't forget to "Save mapfile" to see the result of the classification.``

How to define advanced class symbology ?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

    The procedure is the following::

        Select a class
        You have the possibility to modify existing style or to add new style (like fill or stroke, buttons on the bottom)
